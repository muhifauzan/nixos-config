# Completed Work - Detailed Checklists

## ✅ **Monitor API Mission - COMPLETE SUCCESS**

### Core Technical Achievements
- [x] **DEBUGGING**: Identified circular dependency in monitor extension system
  - Root cause: `monitors.nix` defined and used `_monitorExtensions` option in same file
  - Used sequential thinking to systematically trace the recursion issue
- [x] **ARCHITECTURE**: Fixed circular dependency 
  - Created separate `monitor-extensions.nix` for extension registry
  - Updated import order in `default.nix` to load extensions first
  - Removed duplicate option definition from `monitors.nix`
  - Eliminated infinite recursion during flake evaluation
- [x] **VALIDATION**: ✅ **COMPLETE VERIFICATION**
  - `nix flake check --no-build` passes (no circular dependency errors)
  - Monitor options evaluate correctly with extension system
  - Hyprland extension options fully functional (vrr, workspace, adaptiveSync, etc.)
  - Type-safe configuration evaluation confirmed

- [x] **Home-manager Integration**: Clean consumption via `extraConfig` without implementation pollution
- [x] **Production Ready**: Full end-to-end validation successful
- [x] **Real Configuration**: Applied to actual monitor setup in `hosts/default/configuration.nix`

### Technical Validation - COMPLETE SUCCESS
- [x] **Flake Check**: All configurations pass validation without errors

- [x] **Option Merging**: Hyprland extensions properly merged with base monitor options  
- [x] **Generated Output**: Proper Hyprland monitor strings and workspace assignments
- [x] **Clean Separation**: Implementation complexity hidden from user-facing configs
