# Knowledge Management System

## 🎯 What This Is
Production-ready workflow system for Claude AI assistance with advanced analytical capabilities. Designed for:
- **Instant context rebuilding** (<30 seconds from fresh sessions)
- **Session continuity** with interruption-resistant progress tracking
- **Self-improving evolution** through systematic feedback integration
- **Project transferability** with clear separation of concerns

## 🚀 Quick Start
**Read `session-start.md` for 30-second onboarding**

## 📁 Architecture
- **`session/`**: Active work coordination (transferable structure, project-specific content)
- **`.project/`**: Project-specific knowledge (NixOS/Hyprland - stays with project)
- **`workflow/`**: Universal knowledge evolution system (fully transferable)
- **`.archive/`**: Completed work history and knowledge evolution insights
- **`session-handoff.md`**: Copy/paste for new chats when context limit reached

## 🧠 Core Capabilities
- **Granular progress tracking** with <5 minute steps for interruption resistance
- **Sequential thinking integration** for complex problem decomposition
- **Time tracking** for productivity insights and pattern recognition
- **Systematic feedback processing** ensuring no insights are lost
- **Automatic pattern extraction** building reusable approach library

## 🎯 Design Principles
- **Self-improving**: Gets better through systematic evolution
- **Transferable**: Copy to any project with clear guidelines
- **Analytical**: Enhanced with structured thinking and time tracking
- **Maintenance-driven**: Proactive knowledge hygiene and optimization
