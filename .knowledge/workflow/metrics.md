# Performance Metrics

## ðŸ“Š Session Efficiency Tracking

### Context Rebuild Time
- **Target**: <1 minute from fresh session to productive work
- **Current**: Not yet measured (baseline needed)
- **Track**: Time from session start to first productive action

### Error Rate
- **Track**: Mistakes/corrections per session
- **Goal**: Decrease over time as knowledge improves
- **Types**: Syntax errors, wrong assumptions, outdated info

### Knowledge Lookup Success
- **Track**: How often I find needed info in .knowledges vs asking you
- **Goal**: Increase self-sufficiency over time
- **Note**: Should decrease questions about previously solved problems

### Questions to Human
- **Track**: Number of clarification questions per session
- **Goal**: Fewer repeat questions, more targeted new questions
- **Quality**: Better questions that advance work vs clarify basics
