# Knowledge System Evolution

## üîÑ Workflow Improvements to Try

### Immediate Ideas (Next 1-2 Sessions)
- [ ] Add metadata headers to track dependencies and usage
- [ ] Create session startup checklist for consistency
- [ ] Test relationship tracking between knowledge files
- [ ] Measure actual context rebuild times

### Medium Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Archive old knowledge that's no longer referenced
- [ ] Optimize file organization based on actual usage patterns
- [ ] Develop templates for common problem types
- [ ] Create quick-reference summaries for complex topics

### Long Term Ideas
- [ ] Integration with temporal knowledge graphs (graphiti)
- [ ] Automated staleness detection
- [ ] Cross-project knowledge templates
- [ ] Performance analytics and optimization
- [ ] **Git Submodule Architecture**: Extract knowledge system to standalone repo
  - Universal workflow processes as git submodule
  - Project-specific content in .knowledge-local/
  - Automatic workflow updates across all projects
  - Clean separation, no manual transfer process
  - Each project: `git submodule add <workflow-repo> .knowledge`
  - Shared evolution across all projects using the system

## üìù Pattern Observations

### What Works Well
*Document successful patterns as we discover them*

### What Doesn't Work
*Document failed approaches to avoid repeating*

### Workflow Changes Tried

#### ‚úÖ Feedback Integration Workflow (2025-01-09)
**Problem**: Feedback items created but not systematically processed
**Solution**: 5-step feedback integration process (capture ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí decide ‚Üí implement ‚Üí integrate)
**Outcome**: No feedback gets ignored, systematic improvement process

#### ‚úÖ Project Transferability Architecture (2025-01-09) 
**Problem**: Knowledge system mixed project-specific with transferable content
**Solution**: Clear separation (.project/ vs workflow/), complete transfer documentation
**Outcome**: System can be copied to any new project with clear guidelines

#### ‚úÖ Granular Progress Tracking (2025-01-09)
**Problem**: Context cutoffs caused lost progress, unclear resumption points
**Solution**: Break large tasks into <5 minute steps, mark each ‚úÖ immediately
**Outcome**: Enables state comparison for abrupt stop detection

#### ‚úÖ State Comparison Recovery (2025-01-09) 
**Problem**: How to detect interrupted work without workflow disruption
**Solution**: Next Claude compares planned next step vs actual project state
**Benefits**: Self-correcting, no interruptions, flexible adaptation
**Implementation**: Document in maintenance.md

*Track experiments and their outcomes*

## üéØ Knowledge Patterns

### Effective Formats
- **Problem**: Clear issue statement
- **Context**: Minimal but sufficient background
- **Solution**: Step-by-step or decision tree
- **Validation**: How to verify it worked

### File Relationships
- **Core**: Stable, project-wide knowledge
- **Active**: Current session work, frequently updated
- **Archives**: Completed work, reference only
- **Templates**: Reusable patterns

## üîß System Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup Triggers
- End of major work phases
- When finding outdated information
- When files become too large (>500 lines)
- When context rebuild takes >2 minutes

### Update Frequency
- **Active**: Every session
- **Core**: When fundamentals change
- **Archives**: Only when referenced again
- **Metrics**: Every session end

*Evolution through practice, not just theory*
