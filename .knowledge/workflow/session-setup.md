# Session Setup for New Projects

## ðŸš€ Initializing .knowledge for New Project

### When to Use This
- Copying .knowledge system to a new project
- Starting fresh project with established workflow patterns
- Setting up session management for new work

### Pre-Setup Checklist
- [ ] Have copied transferable files: `session/`, `workflow/`, `README.md`, `session-start.md`
- [ ] Have left behind: `.project/`, `.archive/` (project-specific)
- [ ] Have current project problem/goal defined by human

## ðŸ“‹ New Project Session Initialization

### STEP 1: Reset Session Content
- [ ] Clear all content from `session/context.md` (keep structure)
- [ ] Clear all content from `session/progress.md` (keep structure)  
- [ ] Clear all content from `session/next-steps.md` (keep structure)
- [ ] Clear all content from `session/handoff.md` (keep structure)

### STEP 2: Initialize Current Problem
- [ ] **Fill `session/context.md`**:
  - Current focus (what problem are we solving?)
  - What we're working on (phase, current step, goal)
  - Success criteria for this work
  - Current problem description

### STEP 3: Set Up Development Approach  
- [ ] **Create `session/approach.md`** (new file):
  - How we're approaching this problem
  - Strategy and methodology
  - Key patterns or references from `workflow/session-patterns.md`

### STEP 4: Initialize Progress Tracking
- [ ] **Fill `session/progress.md`**:
  - Current session date and focus
  - Progress tracking for current work
  - Mark any completed preparation as âœ…

### STEP 5: Define Next Steps
- [ ] **Fill `session/next-steps.md`**:
  - Immediate action items for current problem
  - Priority order and time estimates
  - Success criteria for each step

### STEP 6: Create Project Context (New)
- [ ] **Create `.project/` directory**
- [ ] **Create `.project/project-context.md`**: Tech stack, setup, team context
- [ ] **Create `.project/architecture.md`**: System design (start minimal)
- [ ] **Add other project-specific files as needed**

## ðŸŽ¯ Validation Checklist
- [ ] Can understand current problem in <30 seconds from session files
- [ ] Next steps are clear and actionable
- [ ] Project-specific knowledge separated from transferable workflow
- [ ] Ready to start productive work immediately

## ðŸ“š Reference Patterns
**See `workflow/session-patterns.md` for:**
- Common problem-solving approaches
- Proven development strategies  
- Reusable checklist patterns
- Pattern selection guidance
