# Completion Checklist - MANDATORY for ANY work completion

## ðŸš¨ **AUTOMATIC CONSISTENCY ENFORCEMENT**

**Rule**: Before claiming ANY work is "complete", you MUST verify ALL system references are consistent.

### **Phase 1: Core Session Files (Always Required)**
- [ ] `session/current.md` - Updated narrative status
- [ ] `session/completed.md` - Added achievement to checklist  
- [ ] `session/next.md` - Updated action items
- [ ] `session-handoff.md` - Updated handoff status

### **Phase 2: Entry Points (Check Every Time)**
- [ ] `claude-desktop-context.md` - File references are correct (remove status details that belong in session files)
- [ ] `session-start.md` - Any structural changes reflected
- [ ] `session-handoff.md` - Focus on handoff essentials, avoid duplicating detailed achievements

### **Phase 3: Cross-Reference Validation**
- [ ] **Grep check**: Search for old file names to find missed references
- [ ] **Status check**: All "planning/in-progress" language updated to "complete"  
- [ ] **Link check**: All internal .md links point to existing files
- [ ] **Date check**: All timestamps reflect current session

### **Phase 4: Forced Verification Questions**
Ask yourself these BEFORE claiming completion:
- [ ] "If a new Claude read claude-desktop-context.md right now, would they get accurate information?"
- [ ] "Are there any files that still say 'planning' or 'will do' for work I just finished?"
- [ ] "Did I update EVERY file that mentions this work, not just the main ones?"

## ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION RULE**

**When you complete ANY work:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run this checklist
2. **DO NOT** ask permission for obvious updates
3. **DO NOT** declare completion until checklist passes
4. **UPDATE** completion checklist if you find gaps

**Example**: Just finished progressive detail restructure? Run the checklist automatically:
- âœ… Update session files with completion status  
- âœ… Update claude-desktop-context.md current phase
- âœ… Fix any file references that changed
- âœ… Search for "planning restructure" and replace with "completed restructure"
- âœ… Verify new Claude would get consistent information

## ðŸš¨ **ENFORCEMENT**

**If you skip this checklist**: The work doesn't count as complete, even if technically functional.

**If you ask permission for obvious updates**: You're avoiding the systematic approach.

**If you leave inconsistencies**: You're creating hiccups for future sessions.
