# Feedback Requests

## ðŸ¤” When to Ask Human for Help

### Knowledge Quality Issues
**Ask when:**
- Information seems outdated or contradictory
- I keep making the same mistake despite having "knowledge" about it
- Multiple knowledge files conflict on the same topic
- Solutions documented don't work anymore

**Format**: "This knowledge seems wrong: [specific issue]. Can you confirm/correct?"

### Workflow Problems
**Ask when:**
- Taking >2 minutes to find information in .knowledges
- Repeatedly looking for same info in different sessions
- Knowledge structure confusing rather than helping
- Missing critical context for common tasks

**Format**: "Workflow issue: [specific problem]. How should I improve this?"

### Understanding Gaps
**Ask when:**
- Repeating same questions across sessions
- Making assumptions about project structure/goals
- Uncertain about priorities or next steps
- Need clarification on project context

**Format**: "I keep getting confused about [topic]. Can you clarify?"

## ðŸ“‹ Session Review Questions
At end of productive sessions, consider asking:
- "Did I miss anything important in my knowledge updates?"
- "Were my questions/approaches efficient this session?"
- "Should I reorganize any knowledge that seemed hard to find?"

## ðŸš« Don't Ask About
- Information clearly documented and current
- Recently clarified topics (check session notes first)
- Basic NixOS/programming concepts (research first)
- Preferences clearly stated in knowledge files

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Feedback
Ask for feedback when:
- Workflow changes don't seem to help
- Error rates aren't improving
- Context rebuild times increase
- Knowledge system feels more complex than helpful
